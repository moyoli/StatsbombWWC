# Friends of Tracking
Friends of Tracking ran a course in April 2020, on the basics of football analytics. We used Women's World Cup data from Statsbomb data to learn how to load data, create pass and shot maps, track physical performance, apply pitch control models and more. The code here is from each of those lessons.
Lesson 1: Loading and investigating WC data
Lesson 2: Passmaps and shot maps
Lesson 3: Intro to Tracking data
Lesson 4: Delving Deeper - Tracking Physical Performance
Lesson 5: Building and applying a pitch control model
